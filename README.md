## Project Description

Our team will be creating a fullstack mobile-first application that will allow people to share their travel experience to a community of other travellers using this application. The users will be able to browse through other user's travel experience like on a feed, as well as post their own. The user can add multiple factors about their experience such as location, images, cost of travel, places to visit, etc.

## Issues and Resolutions
Because we incorporated a User Auth, we had some trouble grabbing the posts of each user to display on the Explore page. We found a workaround to make an API Call for one specific user that makes posts with different Usernames. However, when given more time, we definitely want to update the functionality for this one.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
