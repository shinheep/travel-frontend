## Project Description

Our team will be creating a fullstack mobile-first application that will allow people to share their travel experience to a community of other travellers using this application. The users will be able to browse through other user's travel experience like on a feed, as well as post their own. The user can add multiple factors about their experience such as location, images, cost of travel, places to visit, etc.

## Issues and Resolutions
Because we incorporated a User Auth, we had some trouble grabbing the posts of each user to display on the Explore page. We found a workaround to make an API Call for one specific user that makes posts with different Usernames. However, when given more time, we definitely want to update the functionality for this one.
